Much of the film simply chronicles her ritualised routine, but does it in an ultra-minimal, precise style that emphasises the artifice of the whole thing...and gradually the artifice (coupled with the fact that Delphine Seyrig plays the woman) shifts the plot into melodrama, so that the film becomes a bourgeois tragedy.",

Spielberg's evasion of present day realities in an effort to recapture the sheer childlike fun of moviegoing is as perverse as was his previous film, 1941. What he offers is one long, breathtaking chase of a plot as his pre-World War II superhero, outsize and Bogartian, races to prevent the omnipotent Ark of the Covenant from falling into the hands of Hitler's Nazis.

It's so easy to reduce Federico Fellini's three-ring satire of the Euro-chic \"good life\" to iconic scenes, or to accept the movie simply as a canonized classic (of course it's great; they teach it in college courses!), that you can forget what a damning indictment of This Mondo Modern World it really is.\nYes, Film Forum's two-week revival of il maestro's groundbreaking work should be considered mandatory attendance anyway, given that this new 35mm restoration is gorgeous; the movie's aristocratic filth has never looked so pristine. But the real reason to wallow once more in its parade of faux Madonnas and real whores, rich junkies and jerkwads, parasitic paparazzi (a term the film coined), dim-bulb starlets, drunken louts and the lowest of the low---that'd be journalists---is to recognize, with stunning clarity, the morally bankrupt, media-fried here and now. Historians can laud it as the transitional pause before the director fully abandoned any neorealistic flourishes and dove into the psycho-personal surrealism known as the Fellini-esque. Yet everyone else will simply admire, in slack-jawed stupor, the way this 51-year-old time capsule thoroughly predicts the era of TMZ, Paris Hilton and celebutante overload. Everything has changed, and nothing has changed. How sour it still is.\nSee more in Film",

Despite the caricatured acting forms of Noh and Kabuki which Kurosawa adopted in his period films, the individual characterisations are precise and memorable, none more so than that by Takashi Shimura, one of the director's favourite actors, playing the sage, ageing, and oddly charismatic samurai leader.

He finds excuses to spend time with her, apparently intending to jilt her. Then they fall in love, but (aside from one reckless moment in a hotel) repress their feelings. He runs away to work as a journalist in Singapore; in 1966, covering De Gaulle's state visit to Cambodia, he's in Angkor Wat trying to unburden himself of the secret which overwhelms his life...

        "timeout_says": "We begin down a hole. It\u2019s 1898 in the Southern Californian desert and Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a lithe, daddy-long-legs of a man, a lone-gun silver prospector whose tools, as he scratches around in the dark, are a pickaxe, a rope, some dynamite and sheer will. The scene, like many in the film, is gruelling, elemental, horrific even.\nHe falls, breaks his leg and gains a limp that will stay with him for the rest of this bold, epic film. We hop forward to 1902, and Plainview is digging again, only now he\u2019s on the hunt for something else: oil. He strikes black and brandishes his filthy hands to his accomplices. The dirt under his nails is a badge of honour, and one never to be removed; he wears it years later, even when he\u2019s moping around a mansion, his mind driven loopy by success and paranoia.\nAnother hop and it\u2019s 1911, and we reach the meat of the movie. A smarter Plainview, a fedora on his brow, is in the shadows of a meeting of folk in Little Boston, California on whose land he wants to dig. \u2018I\u2019m an oil man\u2026\u2019 he implores, the first noise we hear from his mouth, not a word wasted, barely a breath not invested in his success. His voice is simple but mellifluous, its stresses and dips unusual but alluring. It\u2019s the first hint in this long, odd and stunning film that this character \u2013 this wicked creation, this symbol of a nation, this quiet monster \u2013 will lodge in your psyche long after the movie cuts dead on an ending that\u2019s strange and sudden, irritating and pleasing.\nOn one level, Plainview is a pure businessman \u2013 ruthless, self-centred, adaptable. On another, he\u2019s a mystery \u2013 sexless, rootless, unfathomable, silent. The questions roll off the screen. Does he care for his adopted son, HW (Dillon Freasier) or does he see him only as a useful face to have around during negotiations? Are we meant to root for Plainview\u2019s individualist tendencies against the expansion of the Standard and Union oil companies? No \u2013 as soon as the film hints this is going to be the tale of an underdog, Plainview does something awful. Faceless, corporate behaviour begins to look benign. On yet another level, Plainview reflects, then and now, the power of the church; it\u2019s a local pastor, Eli Sunday (a wily Paul Dano) who leads him to the loot. It\u2019s the same pastor whose pockets he must line and religion he must embrace.\nThis is Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s foundation myth \u2013 taken from Upton Sinclair\u2019s 1927 novel \u2018Oil!\u2019, which in turn was inspired by men like Edward Doheny, the oil man who went from rags to riches and died in 1935 in the same mansion where Anderson shot his final scenes. Anderson\u2019s story is precisely dated, stretching from 1898 to 1927, and mostly lingers around 1911 as Plainview builds a gushing derrick.\nBut the beginning of his film feels like the beginning of the world for all its sense that nothing came before. Anderson is arguing that this chasm in the earth, and similar chasms, were the birthplace of America. Little Boston becomes a theatre for his Genesis, or for Exodus, from which the film takes its name. It\u2019s stressed by the primal buzz of Jonny Greenwood\u2019s wonderful score that\u2019s set to the film\u2019s first image of a barren hillside.\nDay-Lewis\u2019s performance is as good as the awards suggest: it\u2019s big, it\u2019s wild, yet it\u2019s also restrained by the sparing talk of his character and framed by a film whose ambitions are bigger than his acting. That Anderson, the film\u2019s writer-director, whose \u2018Boogie Nights\u2019 was a riot but \u2018Magnolia\u2019 and \u2018Punch-Drunk Love\u2019 both noble failures, has come to make this intelligent and enthralling masterpiece is both a little surprising and intensely satisfying.",

Cary Grant\u2019s Roger Thornhill, the film\u2019s sharply dressed ad exec who is sucked into a vortex of mistaken identity, certainly wouldn\u2019t be out of place in \u2018Mad Men\u2019. But there\u2019s nothing dated about this perfect storm of talent, from Hitchcock and Grant to writer Ernest Lehman (\u2018Sweet Smell of Success\u2019), co-stars James Mason and Eva Marie Saint, composer Bernard Herrmann and even designer Saul Bass, whose opening-credits sequence still manages to send a shiver down the spine.Hitchcock breezes through a tongue-in-cheek, nightmarish plot with a lightness of touch that\u2019s equalled by a charming performance from Grant (below), who copes effortlessly with the script\u2019s dash between claustrophobia and intrigue on one hand and romance and comedy on the other. The story is a pass-the-parcel of escalating threats, all of them interior fears turned inside-out: doubting mothers, untrustworthy lovers, vague government handlers, corrupt cops. Within minutes of the film\u2019s opening, shady strangers in a hotel lobby mistake Thornhill for a \u2018George Caplin\u2019 and from there we sprint from country house to the United Nations, from the ticket hall of Grand Central Station to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. Thornhill\u2019s ignorance of his fate and complete lack of control offer Hitchcock a brilliant blank canvas on which to experiment with a story that would sound ludicrous on paper, yet it feels like anything\u2019s possible in Lehman\u2019s playful script. \u2018I\u2019m an advertising man, not a red herring,\u2019 says Thornhill.

Celebrating its sixtieth, De Sica\u2019s neo-realist lodestone may have retained its vitality over the decades, but whatever sense of anger it whipped up in the disgruntled masses of postwar Rome feels lost to the excessively syrupy score and \u2018doe-eyed kid\u2019 sidekick. Sure, the stark location shooting and a yearning central performance from Lamberto Maggiorani \u2013 a regular stiff who needs to get his stolen bike back \u2013 are beautifully measured, but the laissez-faire approach to metaphor jettisons detail in favour of broader commentary. Why not seek out a DVD of something like \u2018The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\u2019 \u2013 also 60 this year \u2013 to really stoke those feelings of withering disenfranchisement?",

        "timeout_says": "\nChristopher Nolan follows the sombre origin myth of \u2018Batman Begins\u2019 with a less introspective, more frenetic sequel. Once again there are lots of ideas on the boil, this time mostly to do with community action and leadership, but an endless flow of bullets, bombs and bat business drowns out most debate. Right from the off, Nolan sidesteps the analyst\u2019s couch and plunges us straight into battle.\nHe starts with a disorienting bank robbery and from there barely allows us to breathe \u2013 or think, even \u2013 over the next two and a half hours as we swing from the US to Hong Kong and back to the streets of Gotham. Here, the crime rate is soaring, it\u2019s always night, and any daylight leaves you squinting. It\u2019s always downtown too; the city is inescapable, a confusing mix of the pedestrian and the paranoid.For this sequel, there\u2019s a whole lot of story going on, which reduced to basics involves the wildly unpredictable Joker (Heath Ledger) wreaking havoc on Gotham. This perverse clown\u2019s keyword is chaos \u2013 crime without sense \u2013 and there\u2019s more than a nod to the post-9/11 order. \u2018Some men just want to watch the world burn,\u2019 chips in one onlooker. Later, when a good guy turns bad and half his face is burnt to reveal bone and sinew, it\u2019s hard not to recall those images of charred bodies in Iraq.\nLedger makes a great, freaky Joker, with dirty, lank hair, a voice that soars and dives, and a tongue that slithers and salivates. Two scenes stick in the mind: him walking away from a doomed hospital in a nurse\u2019s dress right before an explosion, and later hanging out of the window of a speeding car, tasting the air like a reptile, with the soundtrack falling silent in tribute, freezing this psychotic, iconic villain in time and allowing for a moment of sadness amid the noise. If he wins an Oscar, who\u2019d begrudge him that tribute?Meanwhile,\u00a0Christian Bale\u2019s stately if unmemorable Bruce Wayne/Batman reassumes relationships with Michael Caine\u2019s affable man-servant Alfred, Morgan Freeman\u2019s man-sage Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman\u2019s modest cop, Lieutenant Gordon (whose quietness is drowned out by the film\u2019s bombastics). New to the scene are District Attorney Harvey Dent (a slick Aaron Eckhart), who Wayne wants to promote as a human alternative to his vigilantism (an interesting sideline on the need for humility and choice when picking a leader), and Maggie Gyllenhaal as a replacement for Katie Holmes\u2019s Rachel Dawes, but she barely gets a look-in.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s all very monumental, and the film\u2019s more self-conscious moments, of which there are many, would provoke a giggle if you weren\u2019t distracted by yet another explosion, chase or ratcheting up of a score that shrieks importance.The challenge that Nolan has set himself is to make a comic book film that\u2019s serious, entertaining and popular. It\u2019s a tall order, but an admirable one. \u2018The Dark Knight\u2019 is a film that\u2019s fantastic on the action front, seeds its acrobatics in its own reality, and always feels relevant even when its ideas are drowned out by clatter. That said, every once in a while, you\u2019d like to be able to lean into the screen and tickle somebody\u2019s ribs.",

This horrid fate is narrowly avoided by bracing doses of slapstick (the heroine unravels Charlie's vest thinking it's her ball of wool) and Chaplin's supreme delicacy in conveying all shades of human feeling. Matters aren't helped by the film's structure, which is as tattered and baggy as the tramp's trousers. But there are plenty of great moments, and the occasional comic use of sound (despite its date, the film is silent) is beautifully judged.",

When they put aside their differences and collaborate, they produce work of awe-inspiring beauty, but ultimately the simmering tension between them leads to tragedy.The realisation that we\u2019re in the presence of genius comes just a few minutes into \u2018The Red Shoes\u2019, as a gaggle of eager balletomanes take their places for the inaugural performance of\u00a0 Lermontov\u2019s latest masterpiece. They settle into their seats, the roar around them fades, a cheery onscreen ticker reads \u201845 minutes later\u2026\u2019, and Michael Powell moves us forward in time without even breaking the shot.These quietly radical directorial flourishes can be found throughout the film\u2013 and Powell\u2019s entire canon \u2013 but what sets this greatest of all British filmmakers apart from the competition is his refusal to thrust his genius in the audience\u2019s face, subsuming his natural showman\u2019s flair to the demands of story and character. Until the time comes to cut loose, at which point Powell unleashes the most eyepopping visual extravaganza imaginable. Blending impressionist art and expressionist film, blurring the barriers between theatre and cinema, body and camera, reality and dream, drawing equally on the avant-garde and the classical, the centrepiece ballet is a sequence of sheer, reckless transcendence. It\u2019s here that \u2018The Red Shoes\u2019 becomes more than the sum of its hoary old parts, taking flight as the crowning glory of our national cinema.",

So to those of you who have never seen Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s voluptuous romantic thriller\u2014a circumstance that can be remedied this week at Film Forum\u2014allow us a little envy. For these lucky viewers, the free fall begins now. It starts on a San Francisco rooftop, the edge of which detective Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) clings to for life, while another cop plunges to his death. Our hero then dives further into the husky blondness of Madeleine (Kim Novak, an iconic turn), who might be unwell. And still, the bottom is nowhere in sight.\nThat\u2019s about all you need to know beforehand of Hitchcock\u2019s most tender story. (Go in openhearted.) Many other fans, of course, have kept up an affair with Vertigo for years; it\u2019s a movie about memory that actually improves the more you go over its folds. This time, I noticed a masterful symmetry: Scottie, quietly on the case, follows Madeleine into the hazy, greenish sunlight of a cemetery. Later, she\u2019ll emerge from yet another green haze, a neon light, walking out of death\u2019s grip into his arms.

Then, with the arrival of Sentain (Colin), a soldier Forestier honoured for bravery, Galoup caved in to resentment, envy and hate. Though little is spelt out explicitly in this elliptical tale of repressed emotion leading to murderous jealousy, the film is admirably accessible and clear throughout. The director shows scant interest in the new recruit as an angelic incarnation of goodness - her concerns are with how a wide open colonial outpost may become a prison; how men may cope with an all-male society; how the physical may mirror the metaphysical. Hence, she and her team create a fixed, timeless world of mysterious, balletic rites, rippled with simmering homoerotic tensions. The intensity of mood and thematic resonance both derive almost entirely from the poetic juxtaposition of music and the stunning images of beauty and sustained, even surreal strangeness.

To comment is to betray the film's extraordinary complexity, but basically it returns to two favourite Bergman themes: the difficulty of true communication between human beings, and the essentially egocentric nature of art. Here the actress (named Vogler after the charlatan/artist in The Face) dries up in the middle of a performance, thereafter refusing to exercise her art. We aren't told why, but from the context it's a fair guess that she withdraws from a feeling of inadequacy in face of the horrors of the modern world; and in her withdrawal, she watches with detached tolerance as humanity (the nurse chattering on about her troubled sex life) reveals its petty woes. Then comes the weird moment of communion in which the two women merge as one: charlatan or not, the artist can still be understood, and can therefore still understand. Not an easy film, but an infinitely rewarding one.",

This uncompromising classic also demonstrates his sense of place, character and style: the super-saturated colours and oddball characters of this Brooklyn neighbourhood are indelible. \nThe plot, to the extent that this ensemble piece has one, revolves around a pizzeria owned by Sal (Danny Aiello) and his dispute with local campaigner Buggin\u2019 Out (Giancarlo Esposito). As the heat and the tension rise, the police arrive and turn conflict into tragedy.\nLee creates a remarkably even-handed and nuanced portrait of the way that violence can flare, and how bigotry can build to something much worse, but even he could hardly have guessed how modern this film would feel 30 years later. You watch the police brutality and think of Eric Garner; you see the heat rippling on screen and think of global warming.

Far more people are au fait with this idea, however, than have seen the 1950 film, so this digital restoration as part of the BFI\u2019s Kurosawa retrospective is welcome. Thankfully, visionary 1920s short-story specialist Ryunosuke Akutagawa\u2019s multi-layered tale of rape and murder in feudal Japan doesn\u2019t disappoint, and the switchback narrative, as befuddled parties shelter under the old Kyoto city gate to try and make sense of bandit Tajomaru\u2019s attack on a travelling samurai and his wife, remains engrossing and provocative as conflicting testimonies emerge. Admirers of the subtleties of Ozu and Mizoguchi, however, might find Kurosawa\u2019s upfront project of attempting to make sense of human nature (irredeemable or not?) a little too obviously didactic \u2013 and Toshiro Mifune\u2019s central performance veering on the hammy side of \u2018earthy\u2019. Those cavils aside, what\u2019s still staggering is the vigour, fluidity and sheer invention of Kurosawa\u2019s direction. No one anywhere in 1950 made the camera engage with movement and location in the way Kurosawa does here, slicing through the forest, and bringing a kinetic impact to violent confrontations,\u00a0 which is evidently the foundation for modern action cinema. This level of mastery is timeless, and although the movie is overly deliberate at times, when it takes off, it really flies. An essential reissue.",

        "timeout_says": "Write about what you know, they say. So in 1959 Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, neglected son, passionate reader, delinquent student and cinephile, wrote and filmed one of the first glistening droplets of the French New Wave: \u2018The 400 Blows\u2019, in which Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) demonstrates \u2013 unforgettably \u2013 that a good brain and bad parents don\u2019t necessarily turn a boy into a talented film director, although they will, one way or another, turn him into a liar.Antoine is an inept thief who winds up incarcerated; somehow, Truffaut turned this saga into the most joyous experience you could have in the cinema until his \u2018Jules et Jim\u2019 three years later. The beauty of monochrome \u201950s Paris helps, but the magic is in observing the thrill even a maltreated child will snatch from a book, a film or a day truanting at a funfair, through the gaze of a former critic whose elation at getting his hands on a camera burbles through every shot.This debut made Truffaut\u2019s name, and that of his alter ego, L\u00e9aud. Like Fellini and Mastroianni or Scorsese and De Niro, theirs was a great collaboration: a sleight of character that conjured up a separate entity with a prettier face and a different ending. Or is it different? The famous last shot \u2013 a zoom to a freeze frame as Antoine flees reform school, truanting again but with better reason \u2013 is also a perfect depiction of Truffaut then, en route from nasty past to invisible but promising future. And isn\u2019t that where most of us are? No wonder this film never dates: he was writing about what we all know.",

Star Wars is at least 40 years out of date as science fiction, but objections pale beside the film's major achievement: nearly 50 years after it was conceived, pulp space fiction is here for the first time presented as a truly viable movie genre. Discounting 2001, which isn't a genre movie, it's like watching the first Western to use real exteriors. And audiences rightly feel that this is something they've been owed for some time. Star Wars itself has distinct limitations, but the current return to a cinema of spectacle and wonder is wholly encouraging. Or would you prefer The Sound of Music?",

Of Van Vogt's fiction? Was former John Carpenter collaborator Dan O'Bannon sold out by producers Walter Hill and David Giler's rewrites?). But the limited strengths of its staple sci-fi horrors - crew of commercial spacecraft menaced by stowaway monster - always derived from either the offhand organic/ Freudian resonances of its design or the purely (brilliantly) manipulative editing and pacing of its above-average shock quota. Intimations of a big-budget Dark Star fade early, and notions of Weaver as a Hawksian woman rarely develop beyond her resourceful reaction to jeopardy. At least Scott has no time to dawdle over redundant futuristic effects in the fashion that scuttles his later Blade Runner.",

        "timeout_says": "The director\u2019s own favourite of his 54 movies, Yasujiro Ozu\u2019s 1953 film \u2018Tokyo Story\u2019 surveys the Japanese family in the American-influenced post-war reconstruction period. The story \u2013 never the Japanese master\u2019s greatest interest \u2013 is a simple one. It concerns the visits paid to their children in Osaka and Tokyo by an elderly couple (Tomi, 68, and Shukishi, 70) from the southern seaside\u00a0 town of Onomichi, a quiet fishing port and traditional centre of Buddhist devotion, which was then a day and a night\u2019s train journey from the high-rises, smoking factories and modernity of Japan\u2019s frenetic capital.Often topping lists of the best films of all time, and a great influence on many great directors of the last half century, not least for its purity of expression, this remains one of the most approachable and moving of all cinema\u2019s masterpieces. Furthermore, Ozu\u2019s style \u2013 with its so-called \u2018pillow shots\u2019 (introductory shots of yet-unhabited rooms), low, static camera position, unhurried pacing and elaborately composed frames \u2013 has come to look, in an age of refreshed minimalism, more and more modern. Also, his main interest \u2013 how ordinary human emotions are expressed in the context of the changing modern family \u2013 has become ever more fundamental, relevant and richly rewarding.Ozu\u2019s is a cinema of cumulative impact. The film\u2019s early scenes delve into the cluster of families around Tomi and Shukishi \u2013 busy doctor Koichi; no-nonsense hair-salon owner Shige; sweet widowed daughter-in-law Noriko \u2013 observing their variously neglectful or dutiful relations with little or no introduction. Shukishi goes on a sake binge with old pals and they discuss their estrangement from, and disappointment with, their offspring. You could say that learning to deal with disappointment is the philosophical, even religious, heart of \u2018Tokyo Story\u2019. And the way Ozu builds up emotional empathy for a sense of disappointment in its various characters is where his mastery lies.Not that the film is without irony, lightheartedness or downright comedy \u2013 \u2018No Weddings and a Funeral\u2019, anybody? Ozu had fun \u2013 and an estimated 43 bottles of sake \u2013 collaborating with scriptwriter Kogo Noda\u00a0 on \u2018Tokyo Story\u2019, and his films are as full of spontaneous insights and significant personal detail as those of Ozu-admired Hollywood comedians Ernst Lubitsch or Leo McCarey. But, like Hitchcock, Ozu planned and\u00a0 storyboarded everything with minute precision; no cutaway to a stone lantern or line of washing is accidental and the slow arc of his film must be attentively imbibed for the film\u2019s overwhelming force to be truly felt.None of this would be true, of course, were it not for the strength of the performances, and \u2018Tokyo Story\u2019 is remarkable for the balance and richness of the ensemble playing by such Ozu regulars as Chishu Ryu (as Shukishi) and, especially, the marvellous, eminently graceful Setsuko Hara whose line, \u2018Everyone has to look after their own life first\u2019, is all the more shocking coming as it does from one of the most radiantly selfless characters in the history of cinema.",

In the first story, a mobster (Travolta) is charged with looking after the irresponsible wife (Thurman) of his vengeful boss. In the second, a washed-up boxer (Willis) tries to trick the Mob by failing to throw a fight. And in the third, two hitmen (Travolta and Jackson) carry out a job, only to call on the services of a 'cleaner' (Keitel) when it gets messier than planned. It's the way Tarantino embellishes and, finally, interlinks these old chestnuts that makes the film alternately exhilarating and frustrating. There's plenty of sharp, sassy, profane dialogue, and there are plenty of acute, funny references to pop culture, though the talk sometimes delays the action, and the references sometimes seem self-consciously arch. And there are, too, the sudden lurches between humour and violence - shocking, but without moral depth. What writer/director Tarantino lacks, as yet, is the maturity to invest his work with anything that might provoke a heartfelt emotional response to his characters. Very entertaining, none the less.",

The best comedy since Groundhog Day - better, even, than that - this is more than just a savvy and ingenious satire on media saturation, it's a moving metaphysical fable.

Tarkovsky re-imagines him as a Christ-like cypher for the sufferings of a divided Russia under the Tartar invaders: a troubled visionary reduced to years of silence by the horrors that he witnesses, who finally rediscovers the will to speak - and to paint. The film offers eight imaginary episodes from Rublev's life: the most brilliant coup is the story of a beardless boy saving his own life by pretending that he knows how to cast a giant bell - and finding that he can do it. This boy's blind faith rekindles Rublev's confidence in himself and his people, leading the film into its blazing climax: a montage of details from Rublev's surviving icons.",

He finds bifocals in a pond and calls them Exhibit A of marital murder, only the glasses don't belong to the victim and the wife hasn't killed anyone. Yet when he confronts ostensible black widow Evelyn Mulwray (Dunaway) with the spectacular evidence, the cigarette between his teeth lends his voice an authoritative Bogie hiss. Throughout, Nicholson sexes up mediocre snooping with blithe arrogance and sarcastic machismo. It's the actor's default mode, sure, but in 1974 it hadn't yet calcified into Schtickolson, and in 1974 a director (Polanski), a screenwriter (Towne) and a producer (Evans) could decide to beat a genre senseless and dump it in the wilds of Greek tragedy.

        "timeout_says": "The late twentieth century\u2019s defining anxiety \u2013 nuclear catastrophe \u2013inspired film masterworks in a variety of genres, from noir (\u2018Kiss Me Deadly\u2019) to essay (\u2018Hiroshima, Mon Amour\u2019), faux documentary (\u2018The War Game\u2019) to horror (\u2018Godzilla\u2019). But it found possibly its greatest cinematic expression in Ingmar Bergman\u2019s doom-laden medieval allegory, a film that re-imagines a previous period of existential angst and primal fear: the plague-ridden thirteenth century. \u2018The Seventh Seal\u2019 has the courage to give fear a face. You could say of its most famous image \u2013 returned crusader Max von Sydow\u2019s desperate chess game with Death (Bengt Ekerot), shot in superb high-Gothic relief by cinematographer Gunnar Fischer in homage to an image Bergman remembered from a childhood church visit \u2013 that it has lost none of its power to impress. But, it seems to me, 50 years of relentless quotation and parody have taken some toll, as they have on the climactic improvised \u2018dance of death\u2019.The film\u2019s other inspirations were the extraordinary, sometimes ecstatic, often profane poems and music of the \u2018Carmina Burana\u2019, composed by anonymous wandering scholars scattered by Europe-wide famine, disease and death, which are sung in snatches in the film and echoed in the soundtrack. Bergman\u2019s inclusion of a company of comic travelling players, which may once have seemed like a balancing, populist device, now provides quietly eloquent proof of the great director\u2019s empathy and essential humanism. While \u2018The Seventh Seal\u2019 is most often characterised as a beautifully directed, portentous and despairing cry of abandonment to a godless world, it may be the film\u2019s gentler but insistent curiosity about man\u2019s peculiar talent for survival and artistic expressiveness, even under the direst threat, that ensures it remains not only highly impressive but thought-provoking, relevant and intensely moving in our present, nervous, times.",

Nothing says disconnection so much as giant billboards of yourself commending Suntory whisky to a foreign audience when the shoot behind the ads leaves you stranded in a sterile hotel bar nursing your loneliness over several glasses of the same. That's when he meets Charlotte (Johansson), a soul-searching young New Yorker idling time while her photographer husband disappears on assignment. She recognises a fellow castaway, and soon the two are trading quips and confidences. A comedy of dislocation framing a love story bound up in an expression of existential melancholy, Sofia Coppola's film is a deft, manifold delight. Johansson again impresses as an old head on young shoulders, but it's Murray's infinitely modulated performance that underpins the film. Riffing on his own image, he gives a sweet-sad study of a man lost inside himself, resigned to the likelihood that it's for life. Certainly the film has the ring of experience. The anomie of international living, the push-pull of shirking home. Admittedly it makes life easier on itself by camping up Japan's way-out culture (an irrepressible chat show host and a voluble photo director are particular standouts), but that's in keeping with its alienation principle. So far as the central relationship goes, the film is almost European in its subtlety and nuance. Cinematic cherry blossom.",

In anti-hero Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) we see traits of what would become the archetypal online troll \u2013 he\u2019s bitter, reactionary and self-involved, describing himself as \u2018God\u2019s lonely man\u2019.\nBut still, Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader never treat him with anything less than the utmost empathy. This is a man scarred by war, perplexed by the permissive society and desperate to leave his mark on a world that barely acknowledges his existence. Travis may wear his isolation proudly, but that doesn\u2019t make it any easier to bear.\nForty years on, \u2018Taxi Driver\u2019 remains almost impossibly perfect: it\u2019s hard to think of another film that creates and sustains such a unique, evocative tone, of dread blended with pity, loathing, savage humour and a scuzzy edge of New York cool. Bernard Herrmann\u2019s score sounds like the city breathing, ominous and clammy, while De Niro\u2019s performance is a masterclass in restraint and honesty. Back on the big screen, this is still one of the pinnacles of cinema.",

Chihiro, a sullen and resentful 10-year-old, is moving house with her parents when they stumble into the world of the Japanese gods - where the greedy parents are soon turned into pigs. Chihiro bluffs her way into a job in the resort spa run by the sorceress Yubaba, but at the cost of her human name and identity; she becomes Sen. With her links to her own past slipping away, she finds an ally in Yubaba's factotum Haku, a mysteriously powerful boy who also has a lost identity behind him. Never remotely didactic, the film is ultimately a self-fulfilment drama that touches on religious, ethical, ecological and psychological issues. (There's also an undercurrent of satire: Miyazaki admits that Yubaba's bath-house is a parody of his own Studio Ghibli.) No other word for it: a masterpiece.",

The film's opening scene immediately signals its own subversiveness. In broad daylight, a brother and sister visit their father's grave; seeing a tall man lumbering towards them, Johnny tries to frighten Barbara with a daft Boris Karloff impersonation; suddenly the figure lurches forward and kills him. With the presumed hero dead within the first few minutes, the inexorable logic of the modern 'nightmare movie' is set in motion, and from this moment on the terror never lets up. Together with a small group of fellow survivors, Barbara holes up in a nearby farmhouse, besieged by an ever-swelling tide of flesh-eating zombies. Trapped inside the house, they fight for their lives, but nothing works out as it should; whenever it seems there might be a glimmer of hope, Romero cruelly reverses our expectations. The nihilistic ending, in particular, has to be seen to be believed. Chuckle, if you can, during the first few minutes; because after that laughter catches in the throat as the clammy hand of terror tightens its grip.",

Many, whatever their age, must have loathed the arrogant energy, recklessness and sheer, cocky youth of this pulpy tale of a fast-talking, chain-smoking, big-lipped wideboy (Jean-Paul Belmondo) on the run in Paris with a crop-haired American wannabe journalist (Jean Seberg) who sells copies of the Herald Tribune on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, wears gorgeous dresses, talks happily about her many lovers and has a sculpture of empty Lucky Strike packets spelling out \u2018Pourquoi?\u2019 on the wall of her tiny flat. What\u2019s not to love, you think? What\u2019s not to hate, many surely felt?Fifty years later, \u2018Breathless\u2019 hasn\u2019t entered its dotage yet: it remains a film whose know-it-all front you want to sneer at as much as you want to sigh at Seberg and Belmondo\u2019s style and run along with their sexually frank chat and epigrams about life and love. That \u2018Breathless\u2019 still comes across as modern and confrontational is a sign of how much it\u2019s been copied and how radical it was for a young French filmmaker to pour plaster containing his peculiar concerns about cinema, morality, romance and much else into the tatty mould of the Hollywood gangster B-movie. There are times when it feels like Godard\u2019s first film is designed to be loathed. Look carefully and you\u2019ll spot Godard himself, 28 at the time and already an iconoclastic critic for Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma. He\u2019s the guy in the suit we see snitching on murderous anti-hero Michel Poiccard, pointing him out to the police while pretending to read the paper outside the offices of France Soir. What a rat. But that\u2019s Godard all over. He\u2019s always been an uningratiating, utterly wilful filmmaker \u2013 an artist who invites us into his world and never the other way round. To watch \u2018Breathless\u2019, a film by a young cinephile hopped up on movies and ideas of what they should be, is to walk into the bedroom of the coolest student in town and discover a giant pinboard of loves, hates, inspirations and thoughts, all moving at 24 frames per second. However, Godard makes the whole thing feel uncommonly speedy and disjointed by employing a frenetic package of stylistic tics: his actors\u2019 walking and talking; his cinematographer Raoul Coutard\u2019s handheld location shooting; Martial Solal\u2019s ceaseless jazz score that moves and changes direction so fast it almost trips over itself; and his editors\u2019 jump cuts, which were radical at the time but so common now that we barely notice them. If you\u2019ve never seen \u2018Breathless\u2019, see it now \u2013 but don\u2019t expect an easy ride. If you haven\u2019t seen it for ages, see it again and be surprised at the fresh reactions it provokes. Afterwards, you can talk about modernism, you can talk about Godard\u2019s dismissal of the cin\u00e9ma de papa, you can talk about the documentary flavour of the whole thing mixed with the corny template of the cheap noir\u2026 But there\u2019s one element that it\u2019s hard to deconstruct or sound intelligent about \u2013 the fact that it\u2019s so damn cool.",

This time, the focus is gay rather than straight: fashion designer Petra (once widowed, once divorced) develops a fiercely possessive crush on her model Karin, and, as soon as the one-sided affair reaches its necessary end, starts wallowing in theatrical self-pity. Coldly described, the set and costume design and the hothouse atmosphere represent so much high-camp gloss; but once again this careful stylisation enables Fassbinder to balance between parody of an emotional stance and intense commitment to it. He films in long, elegant takes, completely at the service of his all-female cast, who are uniformly sensational.",

So many keynotes of the genre emerge fully formed here: the use of light and shadow, threat and tension, beauty and ugliness, a man in grotesque make-up threatening an innocent girl. It could be argued that the film set another, less positive precedent that would go on to plague horror cinema: a tendency to prize shock and sensation over character. But \u2018Nosferatu\u2019 remains deeply unsettling: Max Schreck\u2019s contorted performance in the title role, not to mention that hideous, batlike make-up, may be the film\u2019s most iconic image, but the plague-of-rats scene is deeply unnerving too \u2013 we can only imagine how it must have seemed to audiences emerging shattered from the Great War.",

        "timeout_says": "Iris (Morton) has always been jealous of sister Rose (Rushbrook), but when their mother (Tushingham) dies, she's thrown into numb, furious confusion. Rejecting her old life (Rose and boyfriend Gary), Iris turns instead to the discomfort of strangers. At first glance, writer/director Adler's film seems extremely thin. Morton has charisma in spades and wears oddball clothes well. Such blasted poise proves irresistible to Adler, whose frenetic camera feasts on Morton as if she were a piece of meat. We never believe Iris is part of a community; she's more a wandering Lolita, slumming it among ignorant, treacherous low life. And though the sexual commentary is clearly intended to be cold, it's also tiresome. Are the sex scenes exploitative? Who can say. In the last third, however, Adler's strategy becomes clear: she's been playing a waiting game. Rose acquires an integrity that goes beyond mere respectable virtue, and when Iris's grief thaws, her helpless, animal-like pain is overwhelming. More surprisingly, our sense of the will-o'-the-wisp mother gathers force, the 'story' of her complex mothering told through the daughters' pinches, pokes and eventual tender fumblings towards each other. In its own twisty way, then, the film avoids both sentimentality and art-school cool, and with the help of superlative performances from Morton and Rushbrook, digs deep into the psyche.",

In an age of weightless movie spectacles, here\u2019s a movie that feels like it was made by kidnapping $150 million of studio money, fleeing with it to the Namibian desert, and sending footage back to Hollywood like the amputated body parts of a ransomed hostage.It\u2019s been 30 years since we last watched Mel Gibson\u2019s Max Rockatansky drift into the horizon in \u2018Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\u2019, but the Road Warrior hasn\u2019t aged a day. He\u2019s been transformed from a reluctantly charismatic Gibson into a terse Tom Hardy. Yet much has changed in the wasteland that Max wanders. While previous episodes were set amid the rubble of a ruined world, the colourful hyper-saturated landscapes of this new movie locate the story closer to the dawn of a new civilization than the twilight of an old one.\nThings begin inside the mountain stronghold ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), an inbred monster who lords over a society that guzzles its citizens like fuel. Women are drained for their breast milk, girls are farmed for their wombs, and men like Max are used as vehicle ornaments called \u2018bloodbags\u2019. Unsurprisingly, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), Joe\u2019s one-armed lieutenant, is ready for a change. When she drives off with his prized concubines, the warlord unleashes a suicidal eight-cylinder army on their trail. Pretty much the entire film is a screaming death race down Fury Road.Marrying the biting frenzy of Terry Gilliam\u2019s film universe with the explosive grandeur of James Cameron, Miller cooks up some exhilaratingly sustained action. But the key to this symphony of twisted metal is how the film never forgets that violence is a sort of madness. Miller\u2019s world is a raw portrait of man at his most primitive, and the oppression of women has long been a recurring motif. With Theron\u2019s Furiosa behind the wheel, though, \u2018Fury Road\u2019 steers this macho franchise in a brilliant new direction, forging a mythical portrait about the need for female rule in a world where men need to be saved from themselves.That\u2019s why Max is an enduring hero: he knows when to drive off into the sunset. This time, he leaves a generation of blockbuster cinema choking on his dust.",

        "timeout_says": "No deleted scenes or unseen Sheen, just a straight remaster and reissue for the relatively lean, unrelentingly mean original cut of Coppola\u2019s massive man-on-a-mission masterpiece. Shorn of its \u2018Redux\u2019 excesses, which transformed this already epic film into something sprawling, unwieldy and soap-operatic (if still brilliant), it\u2019s remarkable how slick and streamlined the film feels: five guys in a boat, and the river only goes one way.Not that there isn\u2019t room for experimentation. The central storyline \u2013 Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is tasked with tracking down and executing Marlon Brando\u2019s rogue Colonel Kurtz \u2013 is essentially a slender thread upon which Coppola and his co-writer John Milius hang a number of increasingly wild asides. But these brief, brutal and seemingly unconnected incidents work together to drive the film forward: in their very randomness, they build a picture of a war being fought without strategy or clear intent, making Willard\u2019s mission simultaneously clearer and more morally meaningless.In contrast to Coppola\u2019s earlier \u2018The Godfather Part II\u2019 and \u2018The Conversation\u2019, \u2018Apocalypse Now\u2019 isn\u2019t a conspicuously \u2018smart\u2019 film: literary references aside, there are no intellectual pretensions here. Instead, as befits both its tortuous hand-to-mouth genesis and the devastating conflict it reflects, this is a film of pure sensation, dazzling audiences with light and noise, laying bare the stark horror \u2013 and unimaginable thrill \u2013 of combat. And therein lies the true heart of darkness: if war is hell and heaven intertwined, where does morality fit in? And, in the final apocalyptic analysis, will any of it matter?",

        "timeout_says": "\nAng Lee\u2019s adaptation of an Annie Proulx short story arrives amid much chatter from awards-season soothsayers and pundits who have slapped the easy tag of \u2018gay cowboy movie\u2019 on this sensitive, intelligent and pleasingly traditional film. Certainly its two male protagonists, Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger), two free-and-easy 19-year-olds, tend sheep together in rural Wyoming. They favour denim, live close to the land and enjoy \u2013 briefly \u2013 a loving, sexual relationship.\n\nBut there\u2019s little in this film to excite either John Wayne fans or devotees of Warhol\u2019s \u2018Lonesome Cowboys\u2019. Instead, the film\u2019s themes of forbidden love, lost opportunity, marital deception and romantic honesty are quite accessible, mainstream even. The revolution is all off-screen: what ultimately makes \u2018Brokeback Mountain\u2019 a radical project is that it\u2019s set to become the first bona fide, well-made and commercially successful gay weepie to emerge from Hollywood. Jack and Ennis meet on a Wyoming mountainside one summer when both are employed to watch over the flock of a local farm baron (Randy Quaid). Lee indulges wide shots of flowing rivers, travelling sheep, wispy clouds and mountain vistas to canonise the pair\u2019s experience on Brokeback Mountain. He threatens to over-sweeten us with the shallow beauty of a Marlboro commercial or Wrangler advert until, one night on the mountain, a drunken Ennis spits on his hand, turns Jack over and lights the fuse on an on-off love affair that will stretch painfully over two decades but never escape the macho strictures of the rural worlds to which they belong. Both marry; both have kids; both meet occasionally over 20 years for the odd tryst disguised as a fishing trip. For Jack and Ennis, Brokeback Mountain is more than a place; it\u2019s a symbol of what could have been, a state of mind, an unattainable nirvana. \u2018Brokeback got us good,\u2019 sighs Jack to Ennis as their strained friendship floats through the years, forever secret, barely defined, hardly spoken. Always taking his cue from Proulx\u2019s original story (a marvel of epic economy), Lee and his screenwriters Larry McMurty (\u2018The Last Picture Show\u2019) and Diana Ossana present just enough of the pair\u2019s married, post-Brokeback lives to remind us of the conservative and traditional nature of their domestic lives. But what makes \u2018Brokeback Mountain\u2019 more interesting than a well-meaning time capsule of period values are the subtle differences in character that Lee carves between Jack and Ennis. Jack is more exuberant, more romantic, a dreamer who rides the rodeo and hatches impossible plans for him and Ennis to live together. Ennis is a puritan, unadventurous and afraid of himself; he takes solace in violence, holds back emotionally and creates excuses for the stagnation that defines his life. The film is Ennis\u2019s tragedy; it becomes painfully obvious that he left his soul on Brokeback Mountain. It\u2019s a tough act to witness and one that Heath Ledger handles superbly, delivering an increasingly sad, mumbling and desperate performance that smacks of loneliness and alienation. And all because the boy loves the boy but barely knows what such love means, let alone possesses the tools with which to act on it.What we have here is acutely calibrated storytelling. Nothing is wasted. The pacing is calm, the mood sombre, and the adaptation is both respectful and imaginative. Lee retains the taut ease of Proulx\u2019s prose, allowing him to cover a long period of time (about 20 years) without lessening the tragedy at the heart of the tale or offering episodic biographies. Very little is added to Proulx\u2019s story; the film\u2019s screenwriters take smart inspiration from a line here or a comment there, spinning them into well-placed new scenes. \u2018Brokeback Mountain\u2019 deserves all the awards and acclaim that it\u2019s bound to gather in the next couple of months. It\u2019s painful stuff, moving and intelligent. Lee has taken a story of gay love and placed it where it should be \u2013 in the mainstream. He\u2019s delivered a beautifully crafted film to boot.",

First shown in 1933, as humanity were busily gearing up for another round of death-to-everyone, the film doesn\u2019t take the same direct potshots as, say, Chaplin\u2019s \u2018The Great Dictator\u2019. But this is a spikier, subtler, far less sentimental film, using its timely mittel-European setting and Fascist-like decor to mask a pointed attack on American triumphalism and the lunacy of war, all the way back to Thomas Jefferson. The plot sees Groucho playing Rufus T Firefly, the populist revolutionary who takes charge of the remote nation of Sylvania and is pursued by a pair of spies played by Chico and Harpo. But all this is secondary to a series of wildly elaborate set-pieces \u2013 the mirror scene is perhaps the greatest physical comedy routine in slapstick history \u2013 and mind-scramblingly relentless one-liners (\u2018I got a good mind to join a club and beat you over the head with it!\u2019).

A year later, their footage was found. This movie is the last trace of them. This is a horror film made against the grain, in defiance of the genre as it has evolved over the last three decades. After a handful of interviews with the natives, the trio starts to trek through the woods to check out the 'cemetery' rumoured to mark the graves of missing children. At first, they joke around. Then, as they come across strange talismans made of twigs and stones, the mood becomes apprehensive. At night, inexplicable sounds disrupt their sleep. They lose their way in the trees, and the next night, the sounds are closer, stranger, much more frightening. This is back to basics horror: we're in deep dark woods among things that go bump in the night. The actors never put a foot wrong; the video diary form allows no artifice, so that as terror mounts, the dread is infectious. Indeed, the gradual social and psychological breakdown which ensues is often painful to watch. And to listen to, the sound design being extraordinarily evocative. Worse, it stays with you: the film issues a kind of shadow horror that only comes into play later, at night, when you want to forget it.",

Martin Cahill (Gleeson) is forever a few steps ahead of the police, cocking a snook at all the authority figures he's detested since a childhood in the slums, defined by poverty, petty crime and priestly abuse. Determined to get his man, Inspector Ned Kenny (Voight) nevertheless views him with grudging respect, but it's only when he arranges full time surveillance that Cahill's loyal gang begin to buckle under pressure; even then, the self-styled Godfather can probably count on the support of his wife (Kennedy), her sister (Ball), his right-hand man Noel (Dunbar), and an amused, hero-hungry public, so that his pranks and perversions of justice go unpunished. But how long can he get away with refusing to hand over a portion of his spoils to the IRA? Boorman's energetic account of Cahill's real-life escapades (from the book by Paul Williams) is notable for its deft characterisations and authenticity: while Cahill's sentiments and actions are appreciated as the exploits of a canny born rebel, we're never allowed to forget that he's also volatile, violent and, whatever his feelings for his family, ultimately self-obsessed. All the performances are impressive, but Gleeson and Voight are especially memorable, lending an almost tragic air of inexorability to Cahill and Kenny's cat-and-mouse games.",

Florya, a young partisan, left behind as his unit moves to prepare for a renewed German advance, returns to his village to find only a mass of bodies, including those of his family, and later witnesses the entire population of a near-by town being machine-gunned and burnt to death. This epic, allegorical and traumatising enactment of the hellish experience of war (especially its effect upon a generation of the Soviet people) is rendered by Klimov - albeit unintentionally - as a disorienting and undifferentiated amalgam of almost lyrical poeticism and expressionist nightmare.",

Trouble is, McCauley's cunning is at least equal to Hanna's, and that makes him a hard man to nail. Still, unknown to Hanna, McCauley's gang have their own troubles: one of their number is a volatile psychopath, while the businessman whose bonds they've stolen is not above some rough stuff himself. Such a synopsis barely scratches the surface of Mann's masterly crime epic. Painstakingly detailed, with enough characters, subplots and telling nuances to fill out half a dozen conventional thrillers, this is simply the best American crime movie - and indeed, one of the finest movies, period - in over a decade. The action scenes are better than anything produced by John Woo or Quentin Tarantino; the characterisation has a depth most American film-makers only dream of; the use of location, decor and music is inspired; Dante Spinotti's camerawork is superb; and the large, imaginatively chosen cast gives terrific support to the two leads, both back on glorious form.",

Things go badly. This is the original 1980 US version, 24 minutes longer than the one familiar to UK audiences.

        "timeout_says": "In 1977, when 'Star Wars' and 'Close Encounters' were ushering in the age of the blockbuster, a much quieter revolution was taking place in Watts. Charles Burnett (best known for 1990\u2019s 'To Sleep with Anger'), completing his thesis film for UCLA, made one of cinema's greatest evocations of everyday life, capturing the quotidian details of children at play, a man\u2019s emotional withdrawal, the insidious effects of poverty. 'If [\"Killer of Sheep\"] were an Italian film from 1953, we would have every scene memorized,' Michael Tolkin once said. Yet rather than basking in instant name recognition, Burnett\u2019s masterpiece only belatedly receiving a proper theatrical release. Coming right after the blaxploitation craze of the early to mid-\u201970s and more than a decade before the in-the-hood phase of the early \u201990s, 'Killer of Sheep' explores what it means to be a man, a woman, a child just barely eking out a marginally comfortable existence. Stan (Sanders), the increasingly beleaguered paterfamilias who toils in an abattoir, finds fleeting pleasure in dancing with his wife (Moore) before pulling away, or in the caress of his young daughter (Angela Burnett, the director\u2019s child\u2014one of the most preternaturally talented performers ever seen). Almost every scene is accompanied by a song that deeply enhances its resonance: Stan\u2019s daughter sings along joyously off-key to Earth, Wind & Fire\u2019s \u201cReasons\u201d; Dinah Washington\u2019s \u201cThis Bitter Earth\u201d plays during the aforementioned dance and as Stan hoses down sheep entrails. \u201cToday you\u2019re young / Too soon you\u2019re old,\u201d goes the latter tune\u2014a sentiment perfectly realized in Burnett\u2019s perfect film.",

A couple more professional contributions notwithstanding, this was self-reflexively the swansong to their partnership. But if Allen lost the girl, he gained an audience \u2013 and you can\u2019t kvetch without one. Whereas his earlier skittish missives from Napoleonic Russia (\u2018Love and Death\u2019) and the twenty-second century (\u2018Sleeper\u2019) won slight heed, this parochial, present-tense, blatantly personal confection seduced critics, chattering audiences, Oscar voters\u2026\nAllen\u2019s great play was to assume his audience would (be) like him: an informed, solipsistic, nervous fantasist, only too flattered to be set up on screen. (He\u2019d doubtless say he was making the film for himself, which amounts to the same thing.) He invites viewers to laugh with him at him: rather a subject than an object of ridicule, he lances his neuroses preemptively, controlling the exposure. It\u2019s a limited strategy, but still glamorising in its way \u2013 if you can\u2019t be Bogart-smooth in all things, such a fund of wisecracks is a start.\nThe hitch is that Allen\u2019s comic facility disrupts his search for feeling. He begins the film in confessional mode, offering to-camera the \u2018key jokes\u2019 to his condition (he\u2019s silenced later only by the girlfriend who doesn\u2019t get his jokes) \u2013 but wit can be an avoidance technique, and Allen regularly cuts on a gag rather than develop a serious point. It\u2019s not the most fluent of films anyway \u2013 a whimsical collage of childhood reminiscences and adult relationship tableaux \u2013 so while its consonance comes largely from Gordon Willis\u2019s photography and Allen\u2019s spacious sense of New York, pathos comes at best from Keaton\u2019s evaporative performance and a slightly sentimental conception. The jokes, however, just keep coming.",

In Tezuka's dystopia, technology is both fetishised and reviled; rich megalomaniacs feud while disenchanted proles revolt against machines who ask: 'Why do humans use violence to resolve their problems?' Japanese detective Shunsaku Ban arrives in Metropolis with his nephew Kenichi, seeking to arrest corrupt scientist Dr Laughton. What they uncover, however, is Laughton's ultimate assignment: ethereal beauty Tima, built to control the Ziggurat ('the culmination of mankind's long history of scientific achievement'), and ultimately a tool of world domination. At first, the cute protagonists appear oddly out of place against the burnished Art Deco backgrounds. But Otomo's typically sophisticated script ensures slick pacing, combining humour, terror and pathos, particularly in the final scenes. Special mention goes to the vintage jazz and blues soundtrack.",

What makes it a prototype film noir is the vein of unease missing from the two earlier versions of Hammett's novel. Filmed almost entirely in interiors, it presents a claustrophobic world animated by betrayal, perversion and pain, never - even at its most irresistibly funny, as when Cook listens in outraged disbelief while his fat sugar daddy proposes to sell him down the line - quite losing sight of this central abyss of darkness, ultimately embodied by Mary Astor's sadly duplicitous siren.",

The other half will want to slap it around the chops, tell it to stand in the corner and think about what it has done. Touted as the film that set the template for the modern romantic comedy, the question we must ask is: can we find a place in our hearts to forgive it for setting the precedent for such recent abominations as \u2018The Back-Up Plan\u2019, \u2018The Ugly Truth\u2019 and \u2018The Bounty Hunter\u2019? Well, of course we can, but only because Capra\u2019s film has more charm and zeal in a single frame than in all those films put together.It\u2019s the story of a salty, hooch-swilling reporter (Clark Gable) who is thrown together with a spoiled society heiress (Claudette Colbert) on an overnight Greyhound bus to New York. The film (which is being re-released to coincide with a Capra retrospective at the BFI) simply follows them as they bicker, backbite and clamour for the upper hand. Every line of dialogue is calculated bliss, the chemistry between the leads is magnificent, and the backdrop of Depression-era America allows for a prescient and amusing subplot about how well-heeled urbanites are compelled to misbehave when they have no money in their designer pockets. It\u2019s probably more historically important than it is a masterpiece (the last 20 minutes take the missed conections and misunderstandings an inch too far), but it\u2019s still very easy to fall in love with.",

All of Bernardo Bertolucci's glossy, elegantly deviant films are worth seeing to some degree. But unless you're hard up, we suggest skipping the dirty-old-man stuff from his recent two decades, and going straight to the lush period: In between The Grim Reaper (1962), his thorny debut at age 21, and The Last Emperor (1987), an Oscar-approved Marxist tragedy, is a provocateur with no equal.\nIs his masterpiece Last Tango in Paris? Nope, because that film's Brando would hardly have been conceivable without The Godfather and, thus, without Bertolucci's achingly perfect The Conformist, a bold stroke that predicts the entire inward sweep of the 1970s. Our hero, Clerici (Trintignant), is a proto--Michael Corleone: a quiet devil in the backseat. He yearns to fit in, so Mussolini's Fascism calls to him, as does a normal lifestyle with louche, pasta-making Giulia (Sandrelli). But Clerici has dark plans of self-negation; The Conformist is celebrated for cinematographer Vittorio Storaro's tumbling autumn leaves, but its emotional impact involves a tumbling soul.\nFollow Joshua Rothkopf on Twitter: @joshrothkopf",

The younger generations are leaving the matriarch Nana (Day) and the insulated traditional life she symbolises. Tensions are raised by the return of family members Viola, a Baptist missionary, and Yellow Mary (Barbara-O), a proud whore, and by Eli's apprehension that his wife Eula (Rogers) is carrying the child of a rapist. Nana fears these rifts will destroy her family when they leave the home of their African ancestors and calls on the spirit of Eula's unborn child to heal them. \nSteeped in symbolism, superstition and myth, this disconcertingly original film is structured in tableaux which jump through time. The characters speak in the islanders' Gullah dialect and little is explained; however, Dash's universal message about holding on to tradition in the face of change rings clear.",

But any audience member who goes seeking the same is liable to leave disappointed: for all its dry wit and visual splendour, this 1975 adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray\u2019s novel might be the great director\u2019s least satisfying, most disconcerting film \u2013 and that\u2019s what makes it extraordinary. Redmond Barry (Ryan O\u2019Neal) is an Irish rogue who kills his rival in a duel, joins the British Army and heads to Prussia to fight in the Seven Years\u2019 War. He\u2019s a thug, a gambler, a traitor, a womaniser, a soldier and a loving dad \u2013 but O\u2019Neal stays blank-faced, and in true Kubrick fashion we never get a real grip on his character. But that\u2019s surely the point: no man is ever just one thing, and Barry (later Lyndon, when he marries a rich widow) is whoever he needs to be in the circumstances. \u2018Barry Lyndon\u2019 is best known for its photography \u2013 Kubrick borrowed a low-light camera from Nasa so he could shoot in candlelight \u2013 and it is uniquely, heart-stoppingly gorgeous. But there\u2019s much more to it: this is a story of identity, and the lack of it. And it\u2019s fascinating.",

Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt) are the detectives brought together when an obese corpse is discovered in a dismal apartment. Mills, who with his wife (Paltrow) has recently moved to the city from upstate, resents what he perceives as Somerset's patronising attitude; still, the older cop, about to retire and weary of crime and moral apathy, is unusually educated, as becomes clear when they find a second mutilated body and he insists his young partner start reading the likes of Milton, Chaucer and Dante. Somerset's theory? That a messianic murderer is perpetrating crimes to punish the Seven Deadly Sins - in which case there are five more to go. The film's world is so shadowy, decaying and intentionally dated that one often wonders whether anyone involved has heard of electricity; at the same time, however, Somerset and Mills' slow voyage from claustrophobic murk into blinding light makes for a vivid dramatic metaphor. Moreover, Fincher handles the violence with sensitivity, announcing its obscenity in spoken analyses and briefly glimpsed post mortem shots, but never showing the murderous acts themselves.",

The results are so fine \u2013 so modern \u2013 that I can\u2019t think of a better film born of a political struggle, or at least one that moulds political commentary with drama so effectively.

Out hunting deer in the desert down by the Mexican border, Vietnam veteran Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) happens on a heap of carnage: torn-apart trucks, corpses of men and dogs, the bloody bodies of others who\u2019d be better off dead, and a case packed with cash: about $2 million. With no witnesses, and confident he can handle himself, Moss opts to keep what\u2019s clearly payment in a drugs-handover gone wrong, and treat himself and wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) to a life considerably better than their trailer-park existence. Trouble is, psychopathic hitman Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) also wants the loot, and begins carefully hunting the hunter, in turn pursued by veteran sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who can\u2019t help feeling the world\u2019s turning more crazily violent.\nThe Coens\u2019 first outright adaptation is of a Cormac McCarthy novel so attuned to them that the film feels \u2013 at least until the final few scenes \u2013 as if it\u2019s based on one of their own original screenplays: \u2018Blood Simple\u2019 meets \u2018Fargo\u2019, almost. For all its fidelity to its source, however, it\u2019d be wrong to think it merely an illustration. The Coens meticulously select the most filmic moments of McCarthy\u2019s terse, gripping book; they trim the sheriff\u2019s nostalgic reveries and philosophising, embellish and enhance the action, and succeed overall in transforming the novel\u2019s economic descriptions into a full-blown world populated by vivid, plausible characters.\nMost impressive, they find a cinematic equivalent to McCarthy\u2019s language: his narrative ellipses, play with point of view, and structural concerns such as the exploration of the similarities and differences between Moss, Chigurh and Bell. Certain virtuoso sequences feel near-abstract in their focus on objects, sounds, light, colour or camera angle rather than on human presence. As in \u2018Barton Fink\u2019 or \u2018Fargo\u2019, the Coens prove that properly innovative artistry and engrossing entertainment can co-exist to utterly compelling effect.Notwithstanding much marvellous deadpan humour, this is one of their darkest efforts: Chigurh, especially, is a nightmarish creation, polite manners and pageboy bob perversely accentuating the volatility in his strangely logical head. Roger Deakins\u2019 superb camerawork, top-grade performances all round, and understated, assured direction ensure the film exerts a grip from start to end. A masterly tale of the good, the deranged and the doomed that inflects the raw violence of the west with a wry acknowledgement of the demise of codes of honour, this is frighteningly intelligent and imaginative.",

Somehow a deranged and oddly distanced plot is contrived from elements including infidelity, tranquiliser-spiked gazpacho, interior decor, bad fashion, beds on fire, caged animals, demented telephone answering machines, Shi-ite terrorists, motorbikes, sentimentalism, property rental, and madness. Don't expect the delirious, hilarious eroticism of Almod\u00f3var's previous Law of Desire, although the two films share a taste for the thriller elements of high comedy.

As such, perhaps it has now slightly lost its special strangeness, but \u2018The Discreet Charm\u2019 remains both an amusing satire on polite society and a tricksy exercise in pulling the rug out from under our expectations. The story, which has an increasingly improvisatory feel, sees six bourgeois French folk move through various, aborted attempts to sit down for a meal, including a visit to a private home on the wrong day and a trip on the same night to a restaurant where the deceased patron is lying in state in the back room. It still has a compelling and mischievous energy to it.",

Based on a real First World War incident, the film explores the morality of conflict as French Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) is asked to defend three fellow soldiers accused of cowardice and derelicton of duty. So furiously anti-military that it was withdrawn from circulation in France (though not banned, as many believe), it\u2019s one of the great films about authority, rebellion and men under extreme pressure.

But the impressionistic vignettes, coupled with the expert use of overlapping dialogue, also build slowly but surely to create a coherent and persuasive portrait of a society that has somewhere along the way carelessly abandoned its original ideals and turned instead to the false gods of fame, fortune, easy sentiment, self-congratulation and political expediency. If, as some claim, the final assassination attempt is a rather weak attempt at gathering up the many loose ends, that invalidates neither Nashville's vision of a world where appearances count for more than substance, nor the originality and imagination with which it expresses that vision.

There, amid the hostile silences of an off-season resort, they are approached by a blind woman with a message of warning from the dead child; and half- hoping, half-resisting, they are sucked into a terrifying vortex of time where disaster may be foretold but not forestalled. Conceived in Roeg's usual imagistic style and predicated upon a series of ominous associations (water, darkness, red, shattering glass), it's hypnotically brilliant as it works remorselessly toward a sense of dislocation in time; an undermining of all the senses, in fact, perfectly exemplified by Sutherland's marvellous Hitchcockian walk through a dark alley where a banging shutter, a hoarse cry, a light extinguished at a window, all recur as in a dream, escalating into terror the second time round because a hint of something seen, a mere shadow, may have been the dead child.",

        "timeout_says": "Reclaiming the American gangster movie after it had been stolen by the Nouvelle Vague, Penn's film was so successful (and so imitated) that it inevitably met with some grudging devaluation. But it's still great: half comic fairytale, half brutal fact, it reflects the essential ambiguity of its heroes (faithfully copied from history and the real-life Barrow gang which terrorised the American South in the early '30s) by treading a no man's land suspended between reality and fantasy. With its weird landscape of dusty, derelict towns and verdant highways, stunningly shot by Burnett Guffey in muted tones of green and gold, it has the true quality of folk legend.",

        "timeout_says": "This American horror film has more fun playing with racial tensions than with scaring us to death, which for some will be a bit of a letdown. The problem with \u2018Get Out\u2019 is that it is perhaps a touch too in love with its big idea: that for a young African American man, meeting your white girlfriend\u2019s parents might be hazardous to your health. (Even if they do say that they \u2018would have voted for Obama a third time\u2019).\nSerious young photographer Chris (British actor Daniel Kaluuya), clearly adores Rose (Allison Williams, Marnie from \u2018Girls\u2019). Still, their trip out of the city to her family\u2019s secluded mansion in the suburbs fills him with dread. That deer they crash into on the drive up doesn\u2019t help Chris\u2019s fraying nerves \u2013 and the way the animal stares him down during its last gasps feels like a warning.\n\u2018Get Out\u2019 is sharp and cutting during its build-up. Rose\u2019s parents (Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford) are awkwardly ingratiating, making a comic meal out of white liberal privilege (\u2018Hug me, my man!\u2019 Rose\u2019s neurosurgeon dad exclaims meeting Chris). Meanwhile, the family\u2019s black servants disquietingly look on like wide-eyed zombies.\nThe writer-director of \u2018Get Out\u2019 is Jordan Peele, one half of the defunct Comedy Central show \u2018Key & Peele\u2019. While you can\u2019t help but cheer his debut film\u2019s ambitions, the discipline he found in skit-writing is lost here. Many of the brightest moments in \u2018Key & Peele\u2019 were miniature nightmares in themselves \u2013 like their classic sketch \u2018Continental Breakfast\u2019, a \u2018Shining\u2019 parody. \u2018Get Out\u2019, on the other hand, reveals its dirty little secret a bit too broadly. Still, Peel deserves another shot to get it perfect.",
